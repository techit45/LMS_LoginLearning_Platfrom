# Teaching Schedule Performance Optimization Summary

## Issues Identified:
1. **Excessive Console Logging**: Multiple debug logs in render loops causing performance degradation
2. **Missing React.memo**: Components re-rendering unnecessarily 
3. **Inefficient useCallback Dependencies**: Missing proper memoization
4. **Verbose Database Logging**: Real-time subscription logs slowing down the interface

## Optimizations Applied:

### 1. ScheduleGrid.jsx Optimizations:
- ✅ Added React.memo to ScheduleItem, DropZone, InstructorDropZone, and WeekdayWeekendTabs components
- ✅ Disabled excessive debug logging in getScheduleForInstructor function  
- ✅ Commented out verbose state update logging
- ✅ Added useMemo for instructor filtering to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- ✅ Created memoized TimeSlotHeader component

### 2. useSimpleSchedule.js Hook Optimizations:
- ✅ Disabled verbose console logging in fetchSchedules function
- ✅ Commented out debug logging in create/update/delete operations  
- ✅ Reduced real-time subscription logging
- ✅ Disabled database search/verification logging

### Performance Impact:
- **Before**: Interface was "กระตุก" (jerky/laggy) due to excessive logging and re-renders
- **After**: Smooth interactions with minimal console output and optimized component rendering

## Key Files Modified:
- `/src/components/ScheduleGrid.jsx` - Main schedule interface
- `/src/hooks/useSimpleSchedule.js` - Data fetching and state management

## Note for Production:
All debug logging has been commented out rather than removed, so it can be easily re-enabled for troubleshooting if needed. The performance improvements should make the teaching schedule interface much more responsive.
