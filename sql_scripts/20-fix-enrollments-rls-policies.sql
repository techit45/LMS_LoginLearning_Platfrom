-- FIX ENROLLMENTS RLS POLICIES - COMPREHENSIVE FIX
-- Login Learning Platform - Fix 400 Errors
-- ==========================================
--
-- The enrollments table is causing massive 400 errors because the RLS policies
-- are too restrictive for dashboard queries and analytics. This script creates
-- more permissive policies that allow proper access while maintaining security.
--
-- ISSUE: Dashboard service is trying to query enrollments for statistics but
-- getting blocked by RLS policies, causing hundreds of 400 errors.

BEGIN;

-- ==========================================
-- STEP 1: CHECK CURRENT ENROLLMENTS POLICIES
-- ==========================================

SELECT 'CURRENT ENROLLMENTS POLICIES (CAUSING 400 ERRORS):' as info;
SELECT 
    policyname,
    cmd,
    CASE 
        WHEN policyname LIKE '%public_read%' THEN '‚ö†Ô∏è  May be too restrictive'
        WHEN policyname LIKE '%admin_all%' THEN '‚ö†Ô∏è  May not work for super_admin'
        ELSE '?'
    END as potential_issue
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'enrollments' AND schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY policyname;

-- ==========================================
-- STEP 2: DROP ALL EXISTING ENROLLMENTS POLICIES
-- ==========================================

-- Drop all existing policies to start fresh
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_public_read" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_student_manage" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_admin_all" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_read_access" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_create_access" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_update_access" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_read_own" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_create_own" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_update_own" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_admin_all_access" ON enrollments;

SELECT '‚úì Dropped all existing enrollments policies' as step_completed;

-- ==========================================
-- STEP 3: CREATE HIGHLY PERMISSIVE POLICIES
-- ==========================================

-- Policy 1: Allow all authenticated users to read enrollments (for dashboard/analytics)
-- This is needed for dashboard statistics and reporting
CREATE POLICY "enrollments_authenticated_read" ON enrollments
FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL  -- Any authenticated user can read enrollments
);

-- Policy 2: Students can manage their own enrollments
CREATE POLICY "enrollments_student_own" ON enrollments
FOR ALL USING (
    auth.uid() = user_id  -- Students can manage their own enrollments
);

-- Policy 3: Super admins can do everything  
CREATE POLICY "enrollments_super_admin_all" ON enrollments
FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
        WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
        AND role = 'super_admin'
    )
);

-- Policy 4: Regular admins and instructors can manage enrollments
CREATE POLICY "enrollments_admin_instructor_all" ON enrollments
FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
        WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
        AND role IN ('admin', 'instructor')
    )
);

SELECT '‚úì Created permissive enrollments policies' as step_completed;

-- ==========================================
-- STEP 4: ALSO FIX COURSE_PROGRESS POLICIES (GETTING 400 ERRORS TOO)
-- ==========================================

-- Check if course_progress has similar issues
SELECT 'CHECKING COURSE_PROGRESS POLICIES:' as info;
SELECT 
    policyname,
    cmd
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'course_progress' AND schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY policyname;

-- Drop restrictive course_progress policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "course_progress_student_own" ON course_progress;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "course_progress_admin_all" ON course_progress; 
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "course_progress_instructor_view" ON course_progress;

-- Create more permissive course_progress policies
CREATE POLICY "course_progress_authenticated_read" ON course_progress
FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL  -- Any authenticated user can read course progress for analytics
);

CREATE POLICY "course_progress_student_manage" ON course_progress
FOR ALL USING (
    auth.uid() = user_id  -- Students can manage their own progress
);

CREATE POLICY "course_progress_admin_all" ON course_progress
FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
        WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
        AND role IN ('admin', 'instructor', 'super_admin')
    )
);

SELECT '‚úì Fixed course_progress policies too' as step_completed;

-- ==========================================
-- STEP 5: VERIFY POLICIES ALLOW DASHBOARD QUERIES
-- ==========================================

-- Test that basic dashboard queries will work
SELECT 'TESTING DASHBOARD QUERIES:' as info;

-- Test 1: Basic enrollments count (this was failing with 400 errors)
DO $$
BEGIN
    BEGIN
        PERFORM COUNT(*) FROM enrollments;
        RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ Basic enrollments count query: SUCCESS';
    EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
        RAISE NOTICE '‚ùå Basic enrollments count query: FAILED - %', SQLERRM;
    END;
END $$;

-- Test 2: Enrollments with date filter (this was causing the 400 errors)
DO $$
BEGIN
    BEGIN
        PERFORM COUNT(*) FROM enrollments 
        WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days';
        RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ Enrollments date filter query: SUCCESS';
    EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
        RAISE NOTICE '‚ùå Enrollments date filter query: FAILED - %', SQLERRM;
    END;
END $$;

-- Test 3: Course progress queries
DO $$
BEGIN
    BEGIN
        PERFORM COUNT(*) FROM course_progress;
        RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ Course progress count query: SUCCESS';
    EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
        RAISE NOTICE '‚ùå Course progress count query: FAILED - %', SQLERRM;
    END;
END $$;

COMMIT;

-- ==========================================
-- STEP 6: VERIFICATION
-- ==========================================

-- Verify new policies exist
SELECT 'NEW ENROLLMENTS POLICIES:' as info;
SELECT 
    policyname,
    cmd,
    '‚úì Should allow dashboard queries' as expected_behavior
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'enrollments' AND schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY policyname;

-- Count total policies (should have 4 for enrollments)
SELECT 
    'POLICY COUNT VERIFICATION:' as info,
    COUNT(*) as enrollments_policies,
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(*) >= 4 THEN '‚úÖ Sufficient policies created' 
        ELSE '‚ùå Missing policies'
    END as status
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'enrollments' AND schemaname = 'public';

-- Final success message
SELECT 
    'üéâ ENROLLMENTS RLS POLICIES FIXED!' as message,
    'Dashboard 400 errors should now be resolved' as expected_result,
    'Reload your application to test the fixes' as next_step;

-- ==========================================
-- TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
-- ==========================================
/*
WHAT TO TEST AFTER RUNNING THIS SCRIPT:

1. RELOAD YOUR APPLICATION - The browser may have cached the 400 errors
2. CHECK BROWSER CONSOLE - Should see significantly fewer 400 errors
3. NAVIGATE TO ADMIN DASHBOARD - Should load without enrollment errors
4. CHECK DASHBOARD STATISTICS - Should display properly without errors

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- ‚úÖ No more 400 errors on enrollments table
- ‚úÖ Dashboard statistics load properly
- ‚úÖ Admin panel works without errors
- ‚úÖ Students can still manage their own enrollments
- ‚úÖ Security maintained (users can only modify their own data)

ROLLBACK IF NEEDED:
If this causes other issues, you can make enrollments completely public temporarily:

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_authenticated_read" ON enrollments;
CREATE POLICY "enrollments_public_read" ON enrollments FOR SELECT USING (true);

But this is less secure and should only be used for testing.

MONITORING:
- Watch browser console for remaining 400 errors
- Check Supabase logs for any new RLS violations
- Monitor dashboard performance after the fix

The policies are now much more permissive for read operations (which is what 
dashboard needs) while still maintaining write security.
