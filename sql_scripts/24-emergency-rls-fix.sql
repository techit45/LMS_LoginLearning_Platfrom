-- ==========================================
-- STEP 1: DROP ALL EXISTING PROBLEMATIC POLICIES
-- ==========================================

-- Drop ALL existing policies on enrollments (they're causing 400 errors)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_public_read" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_student_manage" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_admin_all" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_read_access" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_create_access" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_update_access" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_read_own" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_create_own" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_update_own" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_admin_all_access" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_authenticated_read" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_student_own" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_super_admin_all" ON enrollments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enrollments_admin_instructor_all" ON enrollments;

-- Drop ALL existing policies on course_progress (also causing 400 errors)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "course_progress_student_own" ON course_progress;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "course_progress_admin_all" ON course_progress;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "course_progress_instructor_view" ON course_progress;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "course_progress_update_own" ON course_progress;

SELECT '‚úì Dropped all existing problematic policies' as step_completed;

-- ==========================================
-- STEP 2: CREATE SUPER PERMISSIVE POLICIES
-- ==========================================

-- ENROLLMENTS: Allow all authenticated users to read (for dashboard)
CREATE POLICY "enrollments_allow_all_authenticated" ON enrollments
FOR ALL USING (
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL  -- Any authenticated user can do anything
);

-- COURSE_PROGRESS: Allow all authenticated users to read (for dashboard)
CREATE POLICY "course_progress_allow_all_authenticated" ON course_progress
FOR ALL USING (
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL  -- Any authenticated user can do anything
);

SELECT '‚úì Created super permissive policies' as step_completed;

-- ==========================================
-- STEP 3: TEST THE POLICIES
-- ==========================================

-- Test enrollments access
DO $$
BEGIN
    BEGIN
        PERFORM COUNT(*) FROM enrollments;
        RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ Enrollments table access: SUCCESS';
    EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
        RAISE NOTICE '‚ùå Enrollments table access: FAILED - %', SQLERRM;
    END;
END $$;

-- Test course_progress access
DO $$
BEGIN
    BEGIN
        PERFORM COUNT(*) FROM course_progress;
        RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ Course progress table access: SUCCESS';
    EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
        RAISE NOTICE '‚ùå Course progress table access: FAILED - %', SQLERRM;
    END;
END $$;

COMMIT;

-- ==========================================
-- VERIFICATION
-- ==========================================

-- Verify policies exist
SELECT 'NEW POLICIES CREATED:' as info;
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('enrollments', 'course_progress') AND schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- Final message
SELECT 
    'üö® EMERGENCY FIX APPLIED!' as message,
    'All authenticated users can now access enrollments and course_progress' as details,
    'This should stop the 400 errors immediately' as expected_result,
    'RELOAD YOUR BROWSER to clear cached errors' as action_required;

-- ==========================================
-- SECURITY NOTE
-- ==========================================
/*
SECURITY WARNING:
This emergency fix makes both tables accessible to ALL authenticated users.
This is less secure than proper row-level policies, but necessary to stop
the 400 errors that are breaking the dashboard.

FOR PRODUCTION:
After confirming this fixes the 400 errors, you should:
1. Identify the correct user reference columns
2. Create more restrictive policies based on actual column names
3. Test that the more restrictive policies don't cause 400 errors

IMMEDIATE TESTING:
1. Reload your browser (clear cached 400 errors)
2. Check browser console - should see fewer/no 400 errors
3. Navigate to admin dashboard - should load properly
4. Check dashboard statistics - should display without errors

If you still see 400 errors after this fix, the issue may be:
- Other tables with restrictive RLS policies
- Application-level permission checks
- Network/caching issues requiring server restart
