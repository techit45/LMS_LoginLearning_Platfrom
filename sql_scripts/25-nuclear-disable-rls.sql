-- This script completely disables RLS on enrollments and course_progress
-- tables to immediately stop the 400 errors. This is a temporary fix
-- while we debug the underlying issue.

-- ‚ö†Ô∏è  SECURITY WARNING: This makes the tables accessible to everyone

BEGIN;

-- ==========================================
-- STEP 1: CHECK CURRENT RLS STATUS
-- ==========================================

SELECT 'CURRENT RLS STATUS (BEFORE DISABLING):' as info;
SELECT 
    tablename,
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled,
    CASE 
        WHEN rowsecurity = true THEN 'üîí RLS ENABLED (causing 400 errors)'
        ELSE 'üîì RLS DISABLED'
    END as status
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('enrollments', 'course_progress')
    AND schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;

-- ==========================================
-- STEP 2: COMPLETELY DISABLE RLS
-- ==========================================

-- Disable RLS on enrollments table (this stops ALL RLS checks)
ALTER TABLE enrollments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Disable RLS on course_progress table (this stops ALL RLS checks)  
ALTER TABLE course_progress DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

SELECT 'üö® RLS COMPLETELY DISABLED ON PROBLEM TABLES' as emergency_action;

-- ==========================================
-- STEP 3: VERIFY RLS IS DISABLED
-- ==========================================

SELECT 'RLS STATUS AFTER DISABLING:' as info;
SELECT 
    tablename,
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled,
    CASE 
        WHEN rowsecurity = true THEN '‚ùå STILL ENABLED (problem persists)'
        ELSE '‚úÖ DISABLED (should fix 400 errors)'
    END as status
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('enrollments', 'course_progress')
    AND schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;

-- ==========================================
-- STEP 4: TEST ACCESS
-- ==========================================

-- Test enrollments access (should work now)
DO $$
BEGIN
    BEGIN
        PERFORM COUNT(*) FROM enrollments;
        RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ Enrollments access test: SUCCESS - No more RLS blocking';
    EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
        RAISE NOTICE '‚ùå Enrollments access test: FAILED - %', SQLERRM;
    END;
END $$;

-- Test course_progress access (should work now)
DO $$
BEGIN
    BEGIN
        PERFORM COUNT(*) FROM course_progress;
        RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ Course progress access test: SUCCESS - No more RLS blocking';
    EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
        RAISE NOTICE '‚ùå Course progress access test: FAILED - %', SQLERRM;
    END;
END $$;

COMMIT;

-- ==========================================
-- FINAL VERIFICATION
-- ==========================================

-- Show current policies (should be irrelevant now since RLS is disabled)
SELECT 'EXISTING POLICIES (NOW IRRELEVANT):' as info;
SELECT 
    tablename,
    policyname,
    '‚ö†Ô∏è  Policy exists but RLS is disabled so it has no effect' as note
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('enrollments', 'course_progress') 
    AND schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- Final success message
SELECT 
    'üö® NUCLEAR OPTION APPLIED!' as message,
    'RLS completely disabled on enrollments and course_progress tables' as action_taken,
    'This should immediately stop ALL 400 errors' as expected_result,
    'RELOAD YOUR BROWSER NOW to clear cached errors' as next_step;

-- IMPORTANT NOTES
-- ==========================================
/*
‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE:

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
- Completely disables Row Level Security on enrollments and course_progress tables
- Makes these tables fully accessible to ALL users (authenticated and anonymous)
- Bypasses ALL security policies and restrictions

WHY THIS IS NECESSARY:
- The 400 errors are still happening despite emergency policy fixes
- Something is fundamentally wrong with the RLS policies
- This nuclear option stops the error spam immediately

SECURITY IMPLICATIONS:
- ‚ùå Anyone can read all enrollment data
- ‚ùå Anyone can read all course progress data  
- ‚ùå No access restrictions whatsoever
- ‚ùå This is NOT suitable for production long-term

IMMEDIATE TESTING:
1. RELOAD your browser completely (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check browser console - should see NO 400 errors on these tables
3. Dashboard should load instantly without error spam
4. All functionality should work smoothly

NEXT STEPS AFTER CONFIRMING FIX:
1. Debug why the RLS policies weren't working
2. Identify the correct column names in enrollments/course_progress
3. Create working RLS policies with correct column references
4. Re-enable RLS with proper policies
5. Test thoroughly before going to production

ROLLBACK (if needed):
To re-enable RLS later:
ALTER TABLE enrollments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE course_progress ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

But don't do this until you have working policies in place!
