# Time Tracking System - Critical Fix Guide

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

The Time Tracking system has several critical database issues that are causing system failures:

### Primary Issues
1. **Missing Foreign Key Relationships** - Supabase cannot find foreign key relationships between time tracking tables and user_profiles
2. **PGRST200 Errors** - `Could not find a relationship between 'time_entries' and 'user_profiles' in the schema cache`
3. **Missing Constraints** - `time_entries_user_id_fkey` and `leave_requests_user_id_fkey` constraints not found
4. **RLS Policy Issues** - enrollments table has overly restrictive RLS causing 400 errors

### Impact
- Time tracking features completely non-functional
- API calls failing with PGRST200 and 400 errors
- User relationships not recognized by Supabase
- Data integrity compromised

## üîß Solution Overview

The fix addresses these issues through a comprehensive database migration that:

1. **Creates proper foreign key constraints** referencing `auth.users(id)`
2. **Fixes RLS policies** on enrollments and time tracking tables  
3. **Adds missing columns** to user_profiles for time tracking
4. **Creates essential indexes** for performance
5. **Establishes helper functions** for time tracking calculations

## üìã Step-by-Step Fix Process

### Step 1: Pre-Fix Verification

Before applying fixes, run this query to check current state:

```sql
-- Check current foreign key constraints
SELECT 
    tc.constraint_name,
    tc.table_name,
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' 
    AND tc.table_name IN ('time_entries', 'leave_requests', 'work_schedules')
    AND tc.table_schema = 'public';
```

### Step 2: Apply Critical Fixes

Run the comprehensive fix script in Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor, run:
sql_scripts/16-fix-time-tracking-critical-issues.sql
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
- This script runs in a transaction and will rollback if any errors occur
- All foreign key constraints will be recreated properly
- RLS policies will be fixed to allow proper access
- The script includes diagnostic queries that show progress

### Step 3: Verify Fixes Applied

Run the comprehensive test script:

```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor, run:
sql_scripts/17-test-time-tracking-fixes.sql
```

This will verify:
- ‚úÖ All foreign key constraints exist
- ‚úÖ RLS policies are working correctly  
- ‚úÖ Tables are accessible
- ‚úÖ Sample data can be inserted
- ‚úÖ Functions are working

### Step 4: Apply Detailed RLS Policies (Optional)

For production environments, apply the detailed RLS policies:

```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor, run:
sql_scripts/12-time-tracking-rls-policies-corrected.sql
```

## üîç Key Changes Made

### 1. Foreign Key Constraints Fixed

**Before (Broken):**
```sql
-- Constraints were missing or improperly created
-- Causing PGRST200 errors
```

**After (Fixed):**
```sql
-- Proper foreign key constraints to auth.users(id)
ALTER TABLE time_entries 
    ADD CONSTRAINT time_entries_user_id_fkey 
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE leave_requests 
    ADD CONSTRAINT leave_requests_user_id_fkey 
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

### 2. Enrollments RLS Policies Fixed

**Before (Too Restrictive):**
```sql
-- Policies were blocking legitimate access
-- Causing 400 Bad Request errors
```

**After (Properly Permissive):**
```sql
-- Students can see their enrollments, instructors can see their course enrollments
CREATE POLICY "enrollments_read_access" ON enrollments
    FOR SELECT USING (
        auth.uid() = user_id OR
        EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM courses WHERE courses.id = enrollments.course_id AND courses.instructor_id = auth.uid()) OR
        EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role IN ('admin', 'instructor'))
    );
```

### 3. User Profiles Enhanced

Added essential time tracking columns:
- `employee_id` - Unique employee identifier
- `department` - Employee department
- `position` - Job position
- `hire_date` - Employment start date
- `manager_id` - References manager for hierarchical access
- `is_time_tracking_enabled` - Feature toggle

### 4. Essential Indexes Created

Performance indexes for common queries:
- `idx_time_entries_user_date` - User time entries by date
- `idx_enrollments_user_course` - Enrollment lookups
- `idx_user_profiles_manager` - Manager hierarchy queries

## üß™ Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Verify Foreign Key Relationships
```sql
-- This should return results without PGRST200 errors
SELECT te.*, up.full_name 
FROM time_entries te
JOIN user_profiles up ON up.user_id = te.user_id
LIMIT 5;
```

### Test 2: Verify Enrollments Access  
```sql
-- This should not return 400 errors
SELECT * FROM enrollments LIMIT 5;
```

### Test 3: Test Time Entry Creation
```sql
-- Insert a test time entry (should work without constraint errors)
INSERT INTO time_entries (user_id, company, entry_date, check_in_time)
SELECT user_id, 'login', CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
FROM user_profiles 
WHERE role = 'student' 
LIMIT 1;
```

## üö¶ Verification Checklist

After applying the fixes, verify these items:

- [ ] **Foreign key constraints exist** - Check `information_schema.table_constraints`
- [ ] **RLS policies are active** - Check `pg_policies` table
- [ ] **Tables are accessible** - Query time_entries, leave_requests without errors
- [ ] **Enrollments work** - No 400 errors when accessing enrollments
- [ ] **User relationships work** - JOIN queries between time tracking and user tables work
- [ ] **Functions exist** - `calculate_work_hours` and helper functions are available

## üîÑ Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If the fixes cause issues, you can rollback using the instructions in the fix script:

```sql
BEGIN;
-- Drop created foreign key constraints
ALTER TABLE time_entries DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS time_entries_user_id_fkey;
ALTER TABLE leave_requests DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS leave_requests_user_id_fkey;
-- ... (see full rollback instructions in the script)
COMMIT;
```

## üìä Expected Results

After applying all fixes:

### Before (Broken):
- ‚ùå PGRST200 errors when joining time_entries with user_profiles
- ‚ùå 400 Bad Request errors on enrollments table
- ‚ùå Foreign key constraints missing
- ‚ùå Time tracking features non-functional

### After (Fixed):
- ‚úÖ All table relationships work properly
- ‚úÖ No PGRST200 or 400 errors
- ‚úÖ Foreign key constraints properly established
- ‚úÖ RLS policies allow appropriate access
- ‚úÖ Time tracking system fully functional

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Apply the fixes** using the provided scripts
2. **Run the tests** to verify everything works
3. **Test the frontend** time tracking features
4. **Monitor logs** for any remaining errors
5. **Apply detailed RLS policies** for production security

## üîß Maintenance Notes

- **Foreign key constraints** ensure data integrity and enable Supabase relationships
- **RLS policies** must be balanced between security and functionality
- **Indexes** should be monitored for performance as data grows
- **Regular testing** should verify the relationships continue working
